            <h2> are young drivers over represented in fatal crashes?</h2>

            <p>
                Young drivers are more at risk of fatal speeding accidents as they over-estimate their driving abilities, have a lack of experience, can be influenced by peers, generally drive unsafe cars and are less aware of the risks they are taking. <sup>1</sup>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                 A survey by the Office of Road Safety found that 73% of young males admitted to deliberately speeding, revealing how this demographic is particularly vulnerable to over-estimating driving abilities. <sup>1</sup>
